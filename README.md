# MachineLearningModelsPython

Python code to search list of files in directory from a search list (datasets_selection), read all those files according to read instructions (config), process
data (impute missing values, build pipeline to encode data and transform data) and run various machine learning algorithms (KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree,
Random Forest & AdaBoost) on them. Store perfomance of each model to identify best model (AdaBoost).
